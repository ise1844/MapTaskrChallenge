# MapTaskrChallenge
My code/approach to the challenge

To build and run this solution, it is recommended to have a php server installed.
However, for quick access and verification, you can simply install WAMP or LAMP (Depending if you use windows or linux)
These can be found here: http://www.wampserver.com/en/ or https://www.linux.com/learn/easy-lamp-server-installation
For this challenge, I will document the use of WAMP.
After launching WAMP, drag my directory of files into a new folder within the directory: C:\wamp64\www\
Launch your browser, and enter localhost/*nameofdirectory* into the address bar.
This will display my Contact Us web page.

*EXTRA*
Hi guys,
I came home and wanted to try out doing the same thing with React.js.
The content is located within *src/* and */api* directories.
To use them, start a react app and drop those files in there.
It isn't perfect and doesn't function fully (axios won't accept the directory of the index.php regardless of its location)
